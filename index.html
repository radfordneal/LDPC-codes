<H1> Software for Low Density Parity Check Codes </H1>

<P>Version of 2012-02-11.

<P>This collection of programs and modules, written in C, is intended
to support research and education concerning Low Density Parity Check
(LDPC) codes.  (Note, however, that the copyright notice no longer
restricts use to these purposes).  These error-correcting codes were
invented by Robert Gallager in the early 1960's, and re-invented and
shown to have very good performance by David MacKay and myself in the
mid-1990's.  The decoding algorithm for LDPC codes is related to that
used for Turbo codes, and to probabilistic inference methods used in
other fields.  Variations on LDPC and Turbo codes are currently the
best practical codes known, in terms of their ability to transmit data
at rates approaching channel capacity with very low error probability.

<p>This and past versions of the software are available <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/ldpc.software.html">here</A>,
from <A HREF="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/">Radford Neal<A>'s
web page.  The source code for this software is also <A
HREF="http://github.com/radfordneal/LDPC-codes">hosted at Github</A>,
where there is a <A HREF="http://radfordneal.github.com/LDPC-codes/">copy
of these documentation pages</A> for the latest release.  Github also
provides facilities for bug reporting and discussion.
