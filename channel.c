/* PARSE A COMMAND-LINE SPECIFICATION OF A CHANNEL.  Takes a pointer to an
   argument list and an argument count; returns the number of arguments that 
   make up a channel specification at this point in the command line.  Returns
   zero if the argument list does not start with a channel specification.
   Returns -1 if there seems to be a channel specification here, but it's 
   invalid.

   Sets the variables declared in channel.h to the type and parameters of
   the channel.
