<H1> Installing the LDPC Software </H1>

The LDPC software is written in C, and may well work with any C
compiler, though it has been tested only with gcc, in Unix and Linux
environments, and in the <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</A>
Unix-like environment that runs under Microsoft Windows.  The
installation instructions below assume that you are using a Unix-like
system.

<P>All the software, including the documentation you are viewing here,
is contained in a tar file, which you can download by clicking one
of the options below:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <A HREF="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/ftp/LDPC-2012-02-11/LDPC-2012-02-11.tar">Tar 
   file of LDPC software</A> (0.85 Megabytes)<BR>
 <A HREF="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/ftp/LDPC-2012-02-11/LDPC-2012-02-11.tar.gz">Gzipped
   tar file of LDPC software</A> (0.32 Megabytes)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Once you obtain the tar file (and uncompress it with gunzip if
necessary), you should extract the files with the following Unix command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
tar xf LDPC-2012-02-11.tar
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This will create a source directory called <TT>LDPC-2012-02-11</TT>, and place
all the source, documentation, and other files in this directory.  

<P>If you prefer for this directory to be called something else,
rename it <B>now</B>, before compiling the programs, since the file
<TT>randfile</TT> in this directory, containing natural random numbers,
is accessed according to its path when the programs were compiled.

<P>Once the tar command above has finished, you should change into the
newly-created directory, and type 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
make
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
If all goes well, this should compile all the programs (except for some
test programs, which can be compiled with <TT>make test</TT>).  You
may want to edit the file <TT>Makefile</TT> before running <TT>make</TT>
in order to change compilation options, such as the optimization level.

<P>You can run the programs from this source directory, or you can copy
them to some other directory by running the <TT>LDPC-install</TT>
shell file.  For instance, to install them in a bin directory in your
home directory, do the following:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
./LDPC-install $HOME/bin
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The source directory contains a copy of all the HTML files
documenting the software, such as the one you are reading now, with
the file <TT>index.html</TT> being the starting point.  It is best to
use this local copy when referring to the documentation, rather than
get it off the web, since that is faster and also insures that the 
documentation is for the version that you are using.  Just tell your 
browser to open the URL
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
file:<I>path-to-software</I>/index.html
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT><I>path-to-software</I></TT> is the full path (starting with "/") 
to the directory where you've put the software.

<P>The command
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
make clean
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
will remove all the compiled programs, as well as the files created when
the <A HREF="examples.html">examples</A> are run, and <TT>core</TT>, if it 
exists.
